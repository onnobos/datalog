		<h5>Our Policy</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from you when using the Services. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Data Log Dashboard Terms of Use, and each of the terms defined therein shall apply to this Privacy Policy. By consenting to the Data Log Dashboard Terms of Use, or by using the Data Log Dashboard Websites, Data Log Dashboard Alexa Skill, or Services, you consent to this Privacy Policy and allow collection and use of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<h5>Information We Collect</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">When you interact with us through your use of the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>

		<p class="flow-text">Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily choose to provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services, use certain Services, or authorize us to access data from third-party platforms. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, including through your use of the Services, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data through the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to our offices and servers or those of our affiliates or contractors located in the Switzerland and other countries.</p>

		<h5>Other Information:</h5>
		<p class="flow-text">Non-Identifiable Data: When you utilize the Services, we may receive certain personally non-identifiable information about your use of the Services. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies, or via your use of the Services, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. We may store such information ourselves or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Data Log Dashboard Website, the number of visitors to each page of the Data Log Dashboard Websites, the number of downloads of the Data Log Dashboard Alexa SKill, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>

		<p class="flow-text">Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve Users of the Services, we may conduct research on Users’ demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

		<h5>Third-Party Information</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">Our Services may rely on third-party platforms—such as Amazon—in order to provide both authentication features. When you initially login to the Services using a third-party platform, you are asked to grant us permission to access certain data from such service (“Third-Party Information”). We use Third-Party Information in order to provide the Services both to you and other users. We may share Third-Party Information with users of the Services in order to provide certain features or functionality. The Third-Party Information we collect and use is limited to that information you have explicitly authorized us to access.</p>

		<h5>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">We will use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, if you provide Personal Data to us for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided, including providing portions of your Personal Data—such as your name and contact information—to other Users to facilitate the scheduling of Rides. For instance, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide access to such Services and to monitor your use of such Services. We may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. We may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.</p>

		<p class="flow-text">We will communicate with you through email and notices posted via the Data Log Dashboard Website and Data Log Alexa Skill. These communications may include a series of welcome emails which help inform you about various features of the Services. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from us related to the proper functioning of your account. We don't send you promotional information.</p>

		<h5>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">In addition to the foregoing, there are certain other circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, including as set forth below:</p>

		<p class="flow-text">Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event relating to all or a portion of our business, assets or the Services, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

		<p class="flow-text">Service Providers, Agents and Related Third Parties: We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information and maintaining databases. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we may need to provide them with access to certain Personal Data. However, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>

		<p class="flow-text">Legal Requirements: We may also disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety, rights, and property of Users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

		<h5>Exclusions</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as bulletin boards, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing services, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"), including all User Content that by its nature is accessible or intended to be accessible to other users of the Services. All such Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution. Please also note that any Personal Data or other information you provide, including by authorizing us to access third-party services, such as Amazon, to be displayed in your publicly available online profile will be displayed for others to see and thus will not be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We cannot and will not be responsible for what third parties do with any Personal Data or other information that you voluntarily choose to make publicly available, whether in your profile, or list of activities. As such, we advise that you exercise great care in determining what information you choose to make publicly available through the Services.</p>

We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Data without their parents’ permission. If you have reason to believe that a user under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to us through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

		<h5>Links to Other Websites</h5>

The Data Log Dashboard Website, Data Log Alexa Skill, and Services may frame or contain references or links to other websites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third-Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to the Third-Party Sites. Any links to Third-Party Sites do not imply our review or endorsement of the Third-Party Sites or their privacy policies. We suggest contacting the providers of such Third-Party Sites directly for information on their privacy policies and use and disclosure of information.</p>

		<h5>Security</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These steps include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store Personal Data. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the Internet.</p>

		<h5>Data Integrity</h5>

		<p class="flow-text">We process Personal Data only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the Personal Data needed to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our Users to update or correct their Personal Data whenever necessary.<p class="flow-text">
